        Subcore is a daemon that systematically accesses various sensors and data files
        from your system, and uses that information to optimize your device for
        the workload it requires. This way, no CPU power needs to be wasted on
        basic tasks that require as low as 70% of the CPU they are provided.
        This, in turn, provides outstanding battery life at almost no cost. The
        device will feel smooth as usual.
        \n\nSubcore optimizes multiple aspects of the system, including:
        \n- sysctl (kernel) tweaks
        \n- block (storage) tweaks
        \n- mm (memory) tweaks
        \n- CPU tweaks, GPU tweaks
        \n- scheduler tweaks
        \n- and much more.
        \n\nAfter disabling Subcore, you will need to reboot to get your original kernel
        tweak settings back. This is because Subcore alters sysctl files.
        \n\nThank you for using Subcore and supporting me and my hobby. Contact me
        for criticism, compliments, concerns, or anything else!
