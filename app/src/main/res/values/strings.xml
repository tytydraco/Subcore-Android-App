    <string name="help_text">Subcore is a daemon that systematically monitors various data
        from your system to optimize your device for each unique workload.
        The goal is to conserve power that would otherwise be wasted on
        basic tasks that don\'t require the extra power (such as social media).
        This algorithm provides outstanding battery life at a marginal cost.
        \n\nSubcore monitors and optimizes multiple aspects of the system, including:
        \n- sysctl (kernel) tweaks
        \n- block (storage) tweaks
        \n- mm (memory) tweaks
        \n- CPU tweaks
        \n- GPU tweaks
        \n- scheduler tweaks
        \n- screen state
        \n- battery state and capacity
        \n- and much more
        \n\nWhat\'s more is that Subcore will generate profiles that are unique to the device
        based on its hardware specifications, including RAM size, battery life, max CPU frequency,
        max GPU frequency, CPU governor, and much more. This ensures each device is optimized to its
        full potential.
        \n\nThank you for using Subcore and supporting me and my hobby. Contact me
        for criticism, compliments, concerns, or anything else!
