        Subcore is a daemon that systematically monitors various data input
        from your system to optimize your device for a unique workload.
        The goal is to conserve power that would rather be wasted on
        basic tasks (which require much less power than they are provided).
        This algorithm provides outstanding battery life at little cost. The
        device will feel smooth as usual.
        \n\nSubcore optimizes multiple aspects of the system, including:
        \n- sysctl (kernel) tweaks
        \n- block (storage) tweaks
        \n- mm (memory) tweaks
        \n- CPU tweaks
        \n- GPU tweaks
        \n- scheduler tweaks
        \n- and much more
        \n\nThank you for using Subcore and supporting me and my hobby. Contact me
        for criticism, compliments, concerns, or anything else!
